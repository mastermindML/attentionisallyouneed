# <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">attention is all you need</a>

The Transformer is a neural network architecture that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond since its introduction in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. At its core, the Transformer architecture relies on the mechanism of self-attention to process sequences of data, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence when generating representations.

A crucial component of the Transformer is the position-wise feed-forward network (often abbreviated as FFN) that follows the self-attention layers within each encoder and decoder block. Understanding the feed-forward network in the Transformer context is essential as it contributes significantly to the model's ability to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data.

# Overview of the Transformer Architecture
The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, both built from stacks of identical layers. Here's a high-level view:

Encoder:

Composed of N identical layers.
Each layer has two main sub-layers:
Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism
Position-Wise Feed-Forward Network
Decoder:

Also composed of N identical layers.
Each layer has three sub-layers:
Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism (prevents positions from attending to subsequent positions)
Multi-Head Cross-Attention Mechanism (attends over the encoder's output)
Position-Wise Feed-Forward Network
Each sub-layer is followed by:

Residual Connection: Adds the input of the sub-layer to its output, aiding in training deeper networks.
Layer Normalization: Normalizes the output, improving convergence and stability.
Key Components:
Self-Attention Mechanism: Allows each position in the input sequence to attend to all other positions, capturing dependencies regardless of their distance in the sequence.
Feed-Forward Network: Applies a non-linear transformation to each position independently, further processing the information captured by the attention mechanism.

# The Role of the Feed-Forward Network
The Position-Wise Feed-Forward Network is applied independently and identically to each position (token) in the sequence. It transforms the representations captured by the attention mechanism, introducing non-linearity and enabling the model to capture complex patterns.

Why is it called "Position-Wise"?

Because the same feed-forward network is applied to each position separately.
There is no interaction between positions within the feed-forward network.
This design allows the model to process sequences in parallel.
# Mathematical Details of the Feed-Forward Network

The feed-forward network within the Transformer is typically composed of two linear transformations with a non-linear activation function between them. For a given position in the sequence, the computation is as follows:


# FFN computation
def FFN(x):
    # Linear transformation and non-linearity
    x_transformed = ReLU(np.dot(x, W1) + b1)
    # Second linear transformation
    output = np.dot(x_transformed, W2) + b2
    return output

# Where:
# x: Input vector at a specific position (shape: [d_model])
# W1: Weight matrix (shape: [d_model, d_ff])
# b1: Bias vector (shape: [d_ff])
# W2: Weight matrix (shape: [d_ff, d_model])
# b2: Bias vector (shape: [d_model])

# Activation function
def ReLU(z):
    return np.maximum(0, z)


Non-Linearity (ReLU): Introduces non-linear behavior, allowing the network to learn non-linear relationships.
Second Linear Transformation: Projects back to dmodel​ so that the output can be added to the residual connection and fed into the next layer.

# Intuition Behind the Design Choices
Independent Application: Applying the feed-forward network to each position independently ensures that the model can process sequences in parallel, leveraging modern hardware accelerations like GPUs and TPUs.

Non-Linearity and Depth: Incorporating non-linear activation functions and stacking multiple layers increases the model's capacity to learn complex mappings from input to output.

# Dimensionality Expansion

- The inner-layer dimensionality **d_ff** is larger than **d_model**, providing a richer representation before projecting back down.
- This "bottleneck" design is similar to the structure found in residual networks for computer vision.

**Details:**

- **Input Dimension:** x ∈ ℝᵈᵐᵒᵈᵉˡ
- **Expansion Dimension:** **d_ff** > **d_model**

**Process:**

**First Linear Transformation:**
   
   - x_W = xW₁ + b₁
   - **Dimensions:**
     - W₁ ∈ ℝ<sup>d_model × d_ff</sup>
     - b₁ ∈ ℝ<sup>d_ff</sup>
   
**Non-Linearity:**
   
   - x_R = ReLU(x_W)
   
**Second Linear Transformation:**
   
   - output = x_RW₂ + b₂
   - **Dimensions:**
     - W₂ ∈ ℝ<sup>d_ff × d_model</sup>
     - b₂ ∈ ℝ<sup>d_model</sup>
   
**Residual Connection:**
   
   - Final Output = output + x

- **Expansion:** The input vector x is projected from dimension **d_model** up to a higher dimension **d_ff** to capture more complex features.
- **Compression:** After applying the non-linear activation, it is projected back down to **d_model**.
- **Benefits:**
  - Allows the network to learn richer representations in the higher-dimensional space.
  - The non-linear activation function introduces complexity, enabling the model to learn non-linear relationships.
  - The design mirrors the bottleneck structures in residual networks (ResNets) used in computer vision, which help in training deep networks efficiently.

**Analogous to Residual Networks:**

- In ResNets, bottleneck layers use a similar strategy:
  - **Expansion:** Increase dimensionality to capture complex patterns.
  - **Compression:** Reduce dimensionality to maintain computational efficiency.
  - This helps in preserving important features while reducing the number of parameters.

# Benefits of the Feed-Forward Network in Transformers
Expressiveness: Enhances the model's ability to capture complex patterns and non-linear relationships in the data.
Scalability: Allows for efficient computation due to parallelism, making it suitable for large-scale training.
Versatility: Can adapt to various types of data and tasks by adjusting the architecture's depth and width.

# Comparison with Other Neural Network Architectures
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
Sequential Processing: RNNs process sequences one timestep at a time, which is inherently sequential and less parallelizable.
Memory Constraints: They can struggle with long sequences due to vanishing or exploding gradients.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Sequences:
Fixed Receptive Fields: CNNs use convolutional filters that consider local neighborhoods, which may limit the ability to model long-range dependencies unless deep architectures are used.
Parallelism: CNNs can process sequences in parallel but may require stacking many layers to capture global context.
Transformers:
Attention Mechanism: Allows modeling of dependencies regardless of their distance in the sequence.
Feed-Forward Network: Enhances the model's capacity without introducing sequential dependencies, preserving parallelism.
7. Applications and Impact
The feed-forward Transformer architecture is foundational in many state-of-the-art models and applications:

Language Models:

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): Utilizes the Transformer encoder for tasks like classification, question answering, and more.
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer): Employs a Transformer decoder for text generation and language modeling.
Machine Translation:

The original Transformer model was designed for translating sentences between languages, achieving superior performance compared to previous methods.
Speech Recognition, Image Processing, and Beyond:

Transformers have been adapted for modalities other than text, demonstrating the versatility of the architecture.

The feed-forward network in the Transformer plays a vital role in processing and transforming the representations obtained from the self-attention mechanism. By applying a two-layer linear transformation with a non-linear activation in between, the feed-forward network:

Introduces non-linearities to capture complex patterns.
Processes each position independently, enabling efficient parallel computation.
Enhances the model's expressiveness and depth.
Understanding the feed-forward component is crucial for appreciating how Transformers achieve their remarkable performance across various tasks. The combination of self-attention and feed-forward networks allows Transformers to model intricate dependencies and relationships in data, making them one of the most powerful architectures in deep learning today.
